;;; Commentary:

;; This is an inverse companion to the rx package for translating
;; regexps in string form to the rx notation.  Its chief uses are:
;;
;; - Migrating existing code to rx form, for better readability and
;;   maintainability
;; - Understanding complex regexp strings and finding errors in them
;;   
;; Please refer to `rx' for more information about the notation.
;;
;; The exported functions are:
;;
;;  `xr'              - returns the converted rx expression
;;  `xr-pp'           - pretty-prints the converted rx expression
;;  `xr-lint'         - finds deprecated syntax in a regexp string
;;  `xr-pp-rx-to-str' - pretty-prints an rx expression to a string
;;
;; Suggested use is from an interactive elisp buffer.
;;
;; Example (regexp found in compile.el):
;;
;;   (xr-pp "\\`\\(?:[^^]\\|\\^\\(?: \\*\\|\\[\\)\\)")
;; =>
;;   (seq bos
;;        (or
;;         (not (any "^"))
;;         (seq "^"
;;              (or " *" "["))))
;;
;; The rx notation admits many synonyms; the xr functions mostly
;; prefer brief variants, such as `seq' to `sequence' and `nonl' to
;; `not-newline'.  The user is encouraged to edit the result for
;; maximum readability, consistency and personal preference when
;; replacing existing regexps in elisp code.

;; Related work:
;;
;; The `lex' package, a lexical analyser generator, provides the
;; `lex-parse-re' function which performs a similar task, but does not
;; attempt to handle all the edge cases of Elisp's regexp syntax or
;; pretty-print the result.
;;
;; The `pcre2el' package, a regexp syntax converter and interactive regexp
;; explainer, could also be used for the same tasks. `xr' is narrower in
;; scope but more accurate for the purpose of parsing Emacs regexps and
;; printing the results in rx form.
